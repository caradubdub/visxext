# Gesture Standalone Tracking Page

This standalone page offers a map view of a Gesture delivery in progress, using React, Styled Components, Google Maps API, and Firebase API.

### To Start Development Environment

To start a development environment, you will need to create a Google Maps API key, you can find instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

You need to enable the Maps JavaScript API for your key to work with this app.

Create a .env file and add your API key as GOOGLE_API_KEY.

Once you have done this you can enter `npm run dev` in the terminal and the app will open at localhost:8080.

### To Start Server

Once your API key is set up as above, you can run a production build by running `npm run build`. If build is successful, run `npm start` and navigate to localhost:3000 to see the app on the server.
